# üóº WATCHTOWER

WatchTower is a simple yet very effective WiFi intrusion detection system designed to safeguard your home network against unauthorized access. 
By monitoring incoming data packets and comparing them to a whitelist of known devices, WatchTower swiftly identifies potential intruders. 
When an unknown device is detected, WatchTower triggers a red LED indicator, providing a visual alert. When there is nothing unusual happening, it stays in the shadows
without any sign of life. 

As with any "red" scenario it is good to dive deeper and either mark the device as trusted or change your Access Point password immediately.
WatchTower enables telnet access for you to control its behaviour. 


# üóûÔ∏è Use case

Real world scenario where a friend of mine suspected his AP was used by his neighbour.
Since APs are not user's friendly in terms of notifying you about breaches, i had an idea to simply shine a üî¥ 
when an untrusted device is found using his AP.

We went with WatchTower and found it really happening after few hours.

# üÖ∞Ô∏è How does it work

It is really simple, that's why i like it.

WatchTower will continosuly look for packets going through your AP over WIFI.
All devices that happen to send data with your AP will be added to a list.
Devices are marked **untrusted** by default, so you will need some minimal time to isolate the ones you trust.
Then when you're all set, anytime a device that is **untrusted** is seen talking with your AP, you will get a üî¥ 

Under the hood, you will have access to a telnet server running on the WatchTower,
there you can set names, trust, untrust, add, delete devices.


# üî¥ What next ?

When you get üî¥ and it's not a device that you know - definitely change your WiFi Access Point password ‚ùï

# üì± False positives

## MAC Address Randomization
Some devices have a mechanism called "MAC address randomization".
Ensure to disable it in your mobile phones, tablets or other devices when using WatchTower for your WiFi network as this function randomizes MAC addresses of your devices,
so that whenever they connect, they will use a different address which by WatchTower will be marked untrusted.
